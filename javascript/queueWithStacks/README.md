# Challenge Summary
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class.

## Challenge Description
 Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:

enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.


## Approach & Efficiency
The approach to challenge was to utilize the methods push, pop and peek.
