# FizzBuzzTree
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument.

## Challenge
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O:
time O(n)
space(1)

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
